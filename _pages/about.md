I am a 3rd-year PhD student at Dartmouth College advised by Prof. [Yujun Yan](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/yujunyan/home).
Previously, I received my CS master's degree from University of Virginia, advised by Prof. [Jundong Li](http://www.ece.virginia.edu/~jl6qk/). My [CV](https://tttae.github.io/zheng_huang.pdf).


Research Interest
===
I am interested in **Large Language Models** and **Machine Learning (ML)**, including:

   * **Large Language Models**: Exploration of how large language models and diffusion-based language models represent and reason with knowledge, and how insights from neuroscience can inform the development of more robust, interpretable, and cognitively grounded models
   * **Graph ML**:  Designing frameworks for diverse graph data to enhance model generalizability and applying graph ML models to real-world applications, such as recommender systems
